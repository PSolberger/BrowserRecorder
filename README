BrowserRecorder is a simple browser recorder class.

Based on org.montemedia ScreenRecorder ((c) 2011 Werner Randelshofer, Immensee, Switzerland).

In contrast to the original ScreenRecorder, that provide functionality
to recording from all screen, BrowserRecorder records video directly from
browser window, even if not currently active, focused or on top of screen device.

Build

Build is done using maven.
First of all you'll need to install the Monte Media Library jar artifact in your repository
as it's not currently available at Maven Central.
Download http://www.randelshofer.ch/monte/files/MonteMedia-0.7.7src-cc.zip and uncompress it.

Then install the library by running:
$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/the/path/to/monte-cc.jar -DgroupId=org.monte
-DartifactId=screen-recorder -Dversion=1.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar

Now you are ready to build the browser recorder by running:
$ mvn package

That generates the jar file in the  target  directory.
